# Summary

Made this from a real model.  Took about 50 pictures and use the free version of 3dF Zephyr to create the mesh.  I took an image of the print (with raft still attached) and the actual statue I scanned.  The file file "RabbiticecubeTrayHalf.stl" was an attempt to make an ice cube that looked like a rabbit, but the ice didn't come out because of the geometry. The rabbit does snap into it nicely, however.  For "five bunnies" I  used Cura to arrange and shrink the model to create 5 little bunnies then exported as an STL. These are fun to print out and give to people.  They don't require any support and print quickly.  The small ones need good adhesion to the bed so either print a raft, brim or use glue.
