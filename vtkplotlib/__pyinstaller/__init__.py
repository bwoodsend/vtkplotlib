# ``__pyinstaller/`` |docname| - Provide PyInstaller hooks
# ********************************************************
#
#
# This package provides a hook for PyInstaller
# needed to successfully freeze
# the :doc:`pyi_hooksample package <../__init__.py>`.
# It also provides tests for that hook.
#
# .. toctree::
#   :maxdepth: 1
#
#   hook-pyi_hooksample.py
#   test_hooksample_packaging.py

# For demonstration
# purposes, it also includes the rarely used advanced hook types
# (run-time, pre-find module path, pre-safe import module), though
# these hooks perform no useful role in freezing this project.
