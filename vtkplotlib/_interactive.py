    """:class:`OnClick` provides a higher-level means to attach callbacks to
    mouse click events without unintentionally also catching mouse
    click-and-drag events.

    :param button: Any of *{}* (case-insensitive).
    :type button: str

    :param style: The figure or `vtkInteractorStyle`_ to attach to, writeable.
    :type style: `vtkplotlib.figure`, `vtkInteractorStyle`_

    :param on_click: Method to call when a click happens, writeable, set to None
        to disable, defaults to :func:`print`.
    :type on_click: callable taking a :class:`pick` as an argument, None

    :param mouse_shift_tolerance: The maximum mouse movement in pixels between
        mouse-down and mouse-up allowed for a click to not be counted as a
        click-and-drag, writeable, defaults to ``2``.
    :type mouse_shift_tolerance: int

    :param pick: Set a custom :meth:`pick`, writeable, defaults to creating its
        own on initialisation.
    :type pick: pick

    All parameters are available as attributes with the same name. Of these,
    parameters labelled *writeable* can be set or altered later.

    .. note:: *Forth* and *Fifth* **button** names require ``VTK>=8.0``.

    Usage of :meth:`OnClick` differs from that of
    ``fig.style.AddObserver(event_name, callback)`` in the following ways.

    * Callbacks take a single argument **pick**.
    * The calling of `call_super_callback` is automatic.
    * If using a user-supplied **pick**, then ``pick.update()`` is called
      automatically before passing it to the callback.

    See the example from
    `pick.from\\_ <pick.html#vtkplotlib.interactive.pick.from\\_>`_ for a
    usage demonstration.
