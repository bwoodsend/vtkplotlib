    For regular figures:
        If 'block' is True then it enters interactive mode and the program
        is held until window exit.
        Otherwise the window is opened but not monitored. i.e an image 
        will appear on the screen but it wont respond to being clicked on.
        By editing the plot and calling fig.update() you can create an
        animation but it will be non-interactive. True interactive hasn't
        been implemented yet - use the vtk example to build on top of this.
        And no you can't just run show in a background thread. It just
        doesn't work. If anyone does manage it then please let me know.
            
    For QtFigures:
        'block' is ignored. A QtFigure will become interactive when qapp.exec_()
        is called (which also blocks). Otherwise you get the same unresponsive
        window as you do above.
        
    Important - A window can not be closed by the close button until it is in
                interactive mode. Otherwise it'll just crash python. Use
                vtkplotlib.close() to kill a non interactive window.
