* Made a clumsy mistake in screenshot_fig. Forgot that the window needs to be
  open for it to work. Updated now and added to its test so it doesn't slip by
  again

* Catch and raise an exception raise if unable to open a given image type.

* Add a figure history (`vtkplotlib.figure_history`) to store the most
  recent figure(s).

* Allow cursors (given by `vtkplotlib.scatter` with ``use_cursors=True``) to
  be resized.

* Alias `zip_axes` and `unzip_axes` to the top level package.

*  Fix non-Qt figures not being re `show` able.

* Add a `PolyData` wrapper class for VTK's ``vtkPolyData`` allowing easy
  construction of custom mesh-like objects.

* Encourage a `sys.stdout` flush before starting the interactive renderer.
  This reduces (but does not fix) a race condition between VTK's event loop
  and IPython's console if a figure is shown soon after a `print` statement.

* Add support for non ASCII characters in paths which VTK doesn't handle by
  default.
