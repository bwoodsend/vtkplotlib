* Catch VTK file reading errors and raise them as Python exceptions, replacing
  the pop-up error dialogs VTK uses by default.

* `QtFigure` now supports being re-shown.

* Fix spurious VTK error dialogs from messy garbage collection of figures.

* Allow a `pathlib.Path` to be used in functions where a filename is expected.

* Support TIFF and bitmap image formats using VTK's image reading/writing
  machinery.

* Add patchy support for `io.BytesIO` image files. This is heavily dependent
  on VTK allows it.

* Add a `zoom_to_contents` method.

* Add support for off screen rendering (screenshotting without drawing a
  window).

* Fix the **label** parameter to `quiver` and `arrow` having no effect.
