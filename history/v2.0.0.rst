* Add support for opaque background colors (settable via
  :py:`vpl.gcf().background_opactity = x`). Note that this is for screenshots
  only (e.g. using `screenshot_fig` or `save_fig`). VTK does not support
  tranparent windows so this has no effect on interactive render windows.

* :red:`BREAKING`: `vtkplotlib.screenshot_fig` now returns a
  :py:`(height, width, 4)` array instead of a :py:`(height, width, 3)` array.
  This fourth entry symbolises opacity.

* Fix a segfault when `screenshot_fig` then `show` is called on the same
  `figure`.
